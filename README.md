# üêã OceanSentinel ‚Äì Marine Defense Intelligence Platform

## Overview
OceanSentinel is an ethical, open-source data platform designed to track, analyze, and predict Grindadrap (Grind) hunting activity in the Faroe Islands. This project focuses on using real-time and historical data to provide early warnings and pattern insights to activists and NGOs working to protect marine life.

This platform embodies the principle of **ethical surveillance for life protection**, emphasizing transparency, privacy, and empowerment without punitive state surveillance.

## Mission
- Provide early detection and predictive analytics for Grind hunts using AIS vessel tracking, environmental data, and public reports.
- Build an extensible, scalable data architecture that can later incorporate other marine poaching crimes.
- Support activists and conservationists with actionable intelligence to reduce harm.

## Data Sources (Planned)
- AIS (Automatic Identification System) vessel tracking data near the Faroe Islands
- Historical Grind event data from activist and NGO reports
- Weather and oceanographic data from NOAA and European sources
- Social media and news data for early signals (ethically sourced)

## Tech Stack
- PostgreSQL / PostGIS for spatial data management
- Python for data processing and ML modeling
- Jupyter notebooks for EDA and analysis
- Optional Streamlit dashboard for real-time visualization

## Project Structure
- `/data/` ‚Äî sample datasets for testing and development
- `/notebooks/` ‚Äî exploratory data analysis and modeling
- `/schema/` ‚Äî database schema SQL files
- `/src/data_ingestion/` ‚Äî scripts to fetch and process data feeds
- `/visualizations/` ‚Äî geojson and maps for visualizations
- `/dashboard/` ‚Äî optional Streamlit app for activists

## Roadmap
1. Data analysis & pattern identification of Grind hunts
2. Ethical schema design & implementation
3. ML models for activity prediction and anomaly detection
4. Interactive dashboard for live monitoring (optional)
